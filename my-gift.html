                  My little sister. Her name is Fanamby. I chose that name when she was born. 
                  When my mum was pregnant, I told her that I want a girl but she wanted a boy so she gave me a choice: "If it is a girl, I will allow you to give her name". 
                  The doctor said that my mum will give birth on September but we did not know the date. 
                  September came she did not give birth yet. I said to her: "She will come on 14<sup>th</sup> of September". 
                  What happened?. she wanted to give birth on 13<sup>th</sup> of September so we went to the hospital. Unfortunately, the doctor said: "It is not today". 
                  I was so happy because my dream will became true. I could not find sleep. 
                  My mum gave birth on 14<sup>th</sup> of September, 2018. That was the first time I felt really happy: she is a little girl and then the same birthday to me. 
                  I give her name "Fanamby" which means "a gift". I chose that because she is my gift from my mum. 
                  Two weeks later, I went for camping at <a href="https://mobile.facebook.com/OnjaAfrica/?__tn__=C-R&_rdc=1&_rdr">Onja</a>. 
                  I was so sad but I have a goal to help my family in the future.
