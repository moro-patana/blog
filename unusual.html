    <p>
        For Malagasy people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_brother">Blood brotherhood</a> also
        is the most important relationship.
        My Uncle has blood brotherhood <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antandroy">Antandroy</a> which tribe has 
        own culture. His name is Limby.
        On 2017, Limby's father was dead so we went there to cheer up his family as we we called it <a href="https://mg.wikibooks.org/wiki/Famangiana_manjo">Famangina_manjo</a>
        because we took him as our family.

            Feeling sad

    <p>
        Do you know what happened?
        I want to tell you that I was so shocked by their culture. I could see that
        they were not really sad about their father. All the night they sung and danced
        with a drum. I did not see even one of the family members crying. My Uncle knows
         their culture so he just followed what they asked him to do. I went home because 
         I could stand seeing them dancing and singing but the corps was still there too. 
         When I came home my mum asked me why did I go home. I explained to her; she was just 
         laughing at me. The next day was the burial. They ran when they were carrying the dead body. 
         I was feeling sick two days later. It was still in my mind what they did. Now, I know that 
         it is better to have knowledge about different cultures.
