                    Last year, I lost money just one day after we got an allowance. Somebody broke our house and stole my money. We did not believe it 
                    because our door was still locked. The stealer took my purse. He might have thought that I had a lot of money so brought the purse. 
                    I was not worried about the money but my ID Card in it. We tried to look for it around our fence in case the stealer just took the money 
                    and through the purse away but we could not find it.
                    <br>
                    Here in Madagascar, losing an ID Card is one of the most dangerous. The reason is that the stealer may rubb somewhere and they will drop your ID Card there 
                    to make the society accuse you of being the rubber. In that case, you are in trouble.
                    However, what you should do is go to the police to declare that you lost your ID Card and create a new one again. That's what I did in that situation.

                I was 21 years-old but I have never been to the Police.I am far from my family so I have to solve everything by myself. I went to the Police with fear 
                because I was so afraid of what would happen. Something I did not expect happened. When I lined up waiting for my turn, the security talked to me and 
                asked me about my home town. I explained to him that I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambatondrazaka_District">
                Ambatondrazaka District</a>. During our conversation, he introduced a policeman from Ambatondrazaka too 
                and suggested that I should come to him asking for help. I followed what he said and It was successful. A Policeman's name is Landry. He is sociable and he promised 
                that he will help me until I get a new ID Card. We went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahanoro_(district)">Mahanoro District</a> to create that. It was finished even though It took so long. I thanked them and now we are 
                still communicating with each other. I strongly believe that you should open to everyone because you will not get help from them unless you share what your matter is.
