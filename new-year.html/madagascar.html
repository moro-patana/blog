  <main>
    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
      Handmade is everywhere in Madagascar. Everyone has his/her own skill. Most people in madagascar make craftship such
      as baskets, pockets and hats.
      They use local materials and their products are useful.
      We can find the products in the market or during the exhibition. I was inspired by the young women who are good at
      making the basket. They are so quick and take it as their career.
      So if you want, you can buy them and use them at home or if you will go to the market.

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>
      The cost east of madagascar is the most popular of making craftship because people need hats when they walk
      through the beach.
      The reason why is that the visitors like the place and the weather is too hot. It is also good idea to use basket instead of plastic bags. Do you know why?. Because plastic bags destroy our environment.
      Environmental footprint cause diseases.
